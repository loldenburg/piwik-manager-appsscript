# Piwik Pro Manager

## Quick Start Guide
1. In any Google Sheet owned by you, go to **Extensions -> Apps Script**
2. An Apps Script editor window will open.
3. Copy the code from https://github.com/loldenburg/piwik-manager-appsscript/blob/e03ce406de548d0a6c3bee14aa60ec5245aad45b/mainHandler.js
4. Paste the code into the Apps Script editor window.
5. Give the Apps Script a proper name (= this will be the name in your Google Sheets menu), e.g., "Piwik Pro Manager {My Org}" 
6. Save (e.g. via the "Save" icon).
7. Reload the Google Sheets tab (not the Apps Script Editor).
8. Under "Extensions", you should now see "Piwik Pro Manager". 
9. Run "Setup" and follow the steps there.
